## Speed Monitor

- Website user performance reports for Slack, Rocket.chat & Mattermost
- Captures performance stats using ```performance.timing``` 
- This is NOT a NodeJS package.

## What does it do?

The script captures the users performance using ```performance.timing```

It then sends it to a NodeJS server, storing it in MongoDB and sends reports to Slack, Rocket.chat or Mattermost about the performance.
